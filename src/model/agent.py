_______GENERATED BY CODE_AGENT_______
Module: openai_llm_loader
Description:
- Loads environment variables from a .env file using python-dotenv.
- Retrieves OPENAI_API_KEY from environment.
- Initializes an OpenAI chat model via LangChain with a predefined model version.
- Provides a lightweight UNIT_test function to perform basic integrity checks on module initialization.
Notes:
- Do not modify the existing initialization logic. This file should remain side-effectful
  on import, suitable for environments where the OpenAI API and dependencies are available.
- The UNIT_test function is designed to be a lightweight, non-intrusive test hook that
  can be invoked manually to verify that the expected global variables are present
  and initialized.

# Load environment variables from a .env file

# Initialize the chat model using the specified model name

# Additional comments for maintainability:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY is read at import time; ensure environment variables are present
# - llm is created at import time; subsequent usage should handle potential None or
#   initialization failures depending on dependencies and API availability
